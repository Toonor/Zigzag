After quantization, the DC coefficient is treated separately from the 63 AC
coefficients. The DC coefficient is a measure of the average value of the original 64
image samples. Because there is usually strong correlation between the DC
coefficients of adjacent 8Ã—8 blocks, the quantized DC coefficient is encoded as the
difference from the DC term of the previous block. This special treatment is
worthwhile, as DC coefficients frequently contain a significant fraction of the total
image energy. The other 63 entries are the AC components. They are treated
separately from the DC coefficients in the entropy coding process.
